# Hall-of-Fame
this is a website that I worked on quite a while ago that was originally done in
ColdFusion that I converted to Laravel.

Steps needed to setup:

1.  Create a database
2.  Update the Laravel config file with the database name, username and password
3.  Likeog into the terminal (command line) via telnet/SSH and go to the project home directory
4.  Execute:  php artisan migrate
5.  This will create the required database table
